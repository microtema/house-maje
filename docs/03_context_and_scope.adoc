=== Requirements Overview

The DoC Management System acts as a central hub for only the storage of Declarations of Consent information for European markets This information holds only which channels the customer has consented to (E-Mail, Phone, Postal Mailing, Ecosystem).In addition, the DoC MS stores the minimum customer contact information required to identify a customer and the subsequent Declaration of Consent.
The DoC MS is applicable on all sales level and covers both own retail business and independent retailers. Therefore, there are no differences in the processes described in this document.
Consequently, there are two business processes that the DoC Management System has to handle. The first is the collection of a new DoC. Secondly, the provision of DoC information in case a legal entity (e.g., a retailer or the marketing department of a wholesaler) needs to know if they are allowed to contact the customer through a particular communication channel.
If a positive DoC (E-Mail and/or Phone) already exists from a customer, the aim of OneDoC is not to ask the customer again for a consent. The DoC MS therefore provides its users clear recommended actions. In an online context, it is crucial for the DoC Management System to check the database to see if a customer already exists and if a positive DoC has been given.  Therefore, every online dialog must first deliver customer-identifying data to the DoC Management System. In case, the customer exists with positive DoC, the customer will not be asked to give another consent within the online dialog.

OneDoC is the single point of truth for our customer consents to create value to the world of Mercedes-Benz.

Establish OneDoC (DoC MS) in Europe and beyond Europe as standard consent management and enabler for online and retail business and analytics.

necessarily identical.
